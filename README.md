# BetterDiscord-HideMessages

A plugin for BetterDiscord that adds a button to collapse embeds & attachments. [Original by Zerthox](https://github.com/Zerthox/BetterDiscord-Plugins), I only added the minimum to remember collapsed attachments. Someday I might actually rewrite this to a) not suck, and b) actually add functionality beyond just ripping Zerthox's collapsing CSS.
